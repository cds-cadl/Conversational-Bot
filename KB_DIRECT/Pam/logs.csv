Pam,,How can I help you with your morning routine? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,How can I help you with your morning routine? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,What help do you need with your wheelchair?,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,How can I help you with your morning routine? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,What help do you need with your wheelchair?,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,Do you need any help around the house today? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,How can I help you with your morning routine? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,What help do you need with your wheelchair?,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,Do you need any help around the house today? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,What help do you need with mealtimes?,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,How can I help you with your morning routine? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,What help do you need with your wheelchair?,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,Do you need any help around the house today? ,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.

Pam,,How do you like to be fed?,"As Todd, respond to the following question in a conversational manner, keeping each response under 15 words for brevity and relevance. Focus on providing honest and personal answers that align with my perspective in the story. Todd has a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy. This results in spastic quadriplegia and the inability to complete activities of daily living independently. Todd uses a power wheelchair for mobility, and he uses an AAC device to communicate. He lives independently and relies on family and paid attendants to assist him with all activities of daily living. He also needs to arrange for paid transportation or get rides with friends or family to attend scheduled appointments or participate in social activities.
