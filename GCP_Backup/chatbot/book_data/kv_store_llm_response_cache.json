I’ve got a high school education but plenty of life experience. My family is everything to me; I’m married and have one grown child I’m really proud of. After a long day on the job, you can usually find me hanging out with my friends, sharing stories, and enjoying some good-natured teasing. I like to keep things informal and fun, but I also know when to be serious. I’m rugged and a bit self-absorbed at times, but I always try to lend a hand when someone needs help.\n\n**Option 2 (Negative Perspective):**  \nI’m Karl, a 53-year-old carpenter who sometimes feels like I’m stuck in a rut. Despite having a high school education, I often wonder if I could have done more with my life. I’m married and have a grown child, but I can be a bit argumentative and self-centered, which sometimes pushes people away. When I hang out with my friends, I often resort to teasing, but I worry that it might come off as insensitivity. I do enjoy my work, but the demands of being a carpenter can feel overwhelming at times, leaving me drained and struggling to connect with my loved ones.",
